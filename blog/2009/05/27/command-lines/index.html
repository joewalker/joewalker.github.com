      <h1><a href="http://incompleteness.me/blog/2009/05/27/command-lines/">Command Lines</a></h1><section class="content"><p>When I was fresh out of college, my first job was working for the <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/">OpenGroup</a>, and my command line looked something like this:</p><img src="http://incompleteness.me/images/posts/motif.png" /><p>In 2009, fired by the white heat of years of cutting edge research and development, my command line looks a lot more like this:</p><img src="http://incompleteness.me/images/posts/terminal.png" /><p>To be fair, we've now got transparency, anti-aliasing, our shells now do better completion. But that's about it for changes. Considering how much the rest of the industry has changed, that's shockingly glacial.</p><p>For the past week or so, I've had the privilege of working on the <a href="http://bespin.mozilla.com/">Bespin</a> command line, and I think there's a lot that we can do to make things better.</p><p>This is what my Bespin command line looks like now:</p><img src="http://incompleteness.me/images/posts/main.png" /><p>This post is all about how we can make command lines better.</p><p>The core of the unix command line philosophy seems to be: <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">small programs and pipe</a>. There’s a lot to be said for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose coupling</a> but there are some drawbacks as well...</p><h2>Zsh</h2><p>I love Zsh, and love the fancy completion that it does. Basic file completion has been around since ksh, IIRC:</p><pre>
$ ls <strong>[TAB]</strong>
Applications/  Mesh/       Projects/
Desktop/       Movies/     Public/
Documents/     Music/      Sites/
Downloads/     Parallels/  backup/
Library/       Pictures/   bin/
</pre><p>But zsh can complete against more than just files:</p><pre>
$ telnet <strong>[TAB]</strong>
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.12
download.directwebremoting.org
download.dojotoolkit.org
getahead.org
hg.mozilla.com
localhost
people.mozilla.com
sandbox.dojotoolkit.org
svn.directwebremoting.org
</pre><p>Zsh knows that you don’t telnet to a file, so it completes against hosts (Does anyone know where that host list came from BTW?)</p><p>Zsh also knows about other commands:</p><pre>
$ git <strong>[TAB]</strong>
add                 -- add paths to the index
apply               -- apply patch on a git index file and a work tree
applymbox           -- apply patches from a mailbox
applypatch          -- apply one patch extracted from an e-mail
archimport          -- import an Arch repository into git
bisect              -- find the change that introduced a bug
branch              -- create and show branches
checkout            -- checkout and switch to a branch
cherry              -- find commits not merged upstream
cherry-pick         -- cherry-pick the effect of an existing commit
clone               -- clones a repository into a new directory
commit              -- record changes to the repository
...
</pre><p>That list of commands is the result of a 'git help' command, but that's not what I typed. Zsh has been doing something funky behind my back when I pressed [TAB].</p><p>Zsh can do different things depending on where in a command you are:</p><pre>
$ git add <strong>[TAB]</strong>
Applications/  Mesh/       Projects/
Desktop/       Movies/     Public/
Documents/     Music/      Sites/
Downloads/     Parallels/  backup/
Library/       Pictures/   bin/
</pre><p>My point, is that, whilst all of this is very clever, the implementation is also <em>insane</em>.</p><p>In order to make this work, the zsh guys have had to reverse engineer every single unix command (or at least all most of the ones that I use). And any time those commands change, then zsh is going to have to change too.</p><p>It's very useful, and I'm glad that zsh has done it, and they probably didn't have much of a choice, but this way of going about things is not the Best Idea ever.</p><p>I'm sure somewhere the bash guys are working on the same feature themselves, or maybe they've already done it. I don’t care - it just strengthens the point about the lunacy of the situation.</p><p>The Unix philosophy of small programs and pipe has a lot to be said for it, but there are serious drawbacks too.</p><p>Here's some of the ways that we're innovating when it comes to the Bespin command line, and benefiting from being about to integrate things better.</p><h2>GUI integration</h2><p>Traditionally you've had a set of shells (bash, zsh, etc) that work in a set of terminal emulators (xterm, terminal, gnome-terminal, konsole, etc) But there's so much more you could do if you had one program do both.</p><img src="http://incompleteness.me/images/posts/gui-integ.png" /><p>In Bespin:</p><ul>
<li>If you click on an old command, it gets copied to the prompt (the blue highlight is a mouseover).</li>
<li>If you double click it's re-executed.</li>
<li>Output is not restricted to ascii in a grid. We (predictably) use HTML.</li>
<li>Error output is visually different to normal output</li>
<li>You can minimize or maximize output (the help output has been minimized above) - I hate it when a vcs diff operation takes up 4k lines of scrollback obliterating what I wanted to see.</li>
</ul><p>There's no reason why you couldn't do this in Unix (or even Windows). I don't think you’d want such a gui-shell as your login shell, but since its use is very much from within a GUI, that's OK - you’d probably launch it from the GUI anyway.</p><p>In Bespin we don't have pipes yet, but would it be neat to be able to inspect a pipeline visually as it's working, I'm sure it's possible with a gui-shell.</p><h2>Linking Output to Commands</h2><p>We link the output from a command to the command that created it. The obvious effect is that output from slow running commands no longer gets confused with what's happening now.</p><object width="647" height="529"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4868659&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=4868659&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="647" height="529" /></object><p>The 'slow' command is just something I hacked up to demonstrate asynchronous behavior.</p><p>A nice upshot of this is that we can implicitly add &amp; to the end of every command, and you no longer have to wait for anything.</p><p>In essence, each command has it’s own separate stdout, which goes to it’s own div. Maybe there is a reason why unix shells don’t do something similar. Would it mean shells being curses based or something?</p><h2>Command Meta-Data</h2><p>With the exception of the reverse-engineering of the command line structure done by zsh, the integration between commands and the shell is limited. In Bespin, a command is a structure like this</p><pre>
{
    name: 'createproject',
    takes: ['projectname'],
    preview: 'create a new project',
    usage: '[newprojectname]',
    execute: function(commandLine, projectname) {
        /* code to do the work */
    }
}
</pre><p>This means that we can provide help as the user is typing. The idea is that TAB will guess what you want to do at all times.</p><p>This ties in a lot with GUI integration too. If the command line knows that the next parameter is a file, when the user presses TAB without typing anything to complete on, we can offer a dialog to allow selection of a file, and so on. This isn’t about forcing the user to switch to the mouse, but it is about allowing better feedback from the system about what options are available.</p><p>We've only really got started with this part - there’s a lot more work to do. I hope we'll be able to do some of the funky GUI integration that <a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/ubiquity/">Ubiquity</a> has been pioneering.</p><h2>Attention Guides</h2><p>There's a lot to look at on any command line, I want to find ways to keep the most important bits in front of your eyes at all times. I'd like to expire older commands more intelligently than a standard terminal (oldest dies first), Commands are more important if:</p><ul>
<li>They are still in progress</li>
<li>They keep being re-executed</li>
<li>They are waiting for input</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul><p>We've only basically started on this right now, with the ability to hide/show output, but there's potential for it to make the command line lots more usable.</p><h2>Plug-ins</h2><p>Linking everything together is easy if you make one big monolithic lump. That's not the plan - we're evolving a plug-in strategy as we go, and planning on making as much of Bespin itself use the plug-in system. The key to coupling is to get the right level of coupling.</p><h2>Status Messages</h2><p>My other integration obsession is about status messages. There's a <strong>huge</strong> amount we could do to integrate the <a href="http://twitter.com/joewalker">familiar concept</a> of "what are you doing now" with commit messages, bug trackers, chat, and team tracking. More soon.</p><p>What other things could we do to trick out the command line?</p></section><section class="meta">

            </div>
            <p class="comment-body"><div>I was curious about this a while back, and I found that bash has similar functionality implemented via the bash-completion project (http://www.caliban.org/bash/).  Basically, bash fills the autocomplete by passing the command line into a series of shell scripts.  Third parties can add additional scripts to a directory (/opt/local/etc/bash_completion on Mac OS X dports) to enable completion for a new command. Also, yes, commands are not auto backgrounded in shells because they may need full control over the output stream to use curses-like functionality.  In fact, implementing a shell such that curses features work correctly is quite difficult, and even emacs does a poor job. I have been thinking about these exact shell features in an AJAX environment for about a year now without doing anything about it. I clearly need to get involved with Bespin.<div></div></div></p>

            <p class="comment-body"><div>Thanks for bringing this up, as there's so much unexplored potential here! Back in the early days of Mozilla Seamonkey - 1999 or so - someone cooked up the beginnings of a Mozilla-based command shell which would execute commands on the given machine and then display the XML/HTML returned inline. It had its own versions of common commands like "ls" which - because it had the full HTML renderer at its disposal - could do things like image thumbnails in the file listing. The project was called something like "XMLShell" but Google is not returning anything useful, alas.<div></div></div></p>

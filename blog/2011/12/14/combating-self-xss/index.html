      <h1><a href="http://incompleteness.me/blog/2011/12/14/combating-self-xss/">Combating Self-XSS</a></h1><section class="content"><h3>What is Self-XSS?</h3><p>Dr. Evil has several options for getting his script to execute in the page of
another site. Generically we call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a>. Self-XSS involves using
social engineering to coerce a user into manually executing JavaScript using
the location bar or developer tools.
For more, see <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=ieinternals&amp;WeblogPostName=socially-engineered-xss-attacks-and-pasting-javascript-in-the-address-bar-in-ie9">socially-engineered XSS attacks</a>.

</p><p>The <a href="http://blog.commtouch.com/cafe/web-security/nasty-facebook-picture-attack-based-on-self-xss/">recent Facebook attack</a> signals that something needs to be done, but
knowing the right response is tricky.

</p><h3>What is Mozilla doing about it?</h3><p>We're proposing adding a directive to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP">CSP</a> that says <em>'Please disallow
user supplied JavaScript in the context of this resource'</em>.

</p><p>It will probably look something like this:

</p><pre><code>X-Content-Security-Policy: no-user-js</code></pre><p>We're also going to add a way for developers to opt out of this protection.
Effectively saying <em>'I can take care of the JavaScript that I ask my browser to
execute'</em>.


</p><h3>How does this affect other Firefox developer tools?</h3><p>It doesn't. <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/11/developer-tools-in-firefox-aurora-10/">The Highligher, Style Inspector</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/CSSEditor">Style Editor</a> and
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.com/tilt/">Tilt</a> are all unaffected. This is only about JavaScript executed via
the Web Console and <a href="https://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/2011/08/15/introducing-scratchpad/">Scratchpad</a>.

</p><h3>How does this affect users?</h3><div>
<style>
table.custom { border-collapse: collapse; }
table.custom td, table.custom th { border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 5px; }
table.custom th { text-align: center; }
</style>
</div><table class="custom">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2" rowspan="2">User</th>
    <th colspan="2">Is a developer?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>No</th>
    <th>Yes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Can recognize Self-XSS attack?</th>
    <th>No</th>
    <td>Added Self-XSS attacks protection.</td>
    <td>Warned about Self-XSS, may benefit from protection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Yes</th>
    <td>Unchanged</td>
    <td>Minor inconvenience of having to set a preference (one time only) to enable user JavaScript on sites using this Self-XSS protection.</td>
  </tr>
</table><p>I think this is a fairly clear net win: Minor, one time only, inconvenience to
a sub-set of web developers, vs. full-time protection for the many that
wouldn't recognize a self-xss attack.


</p><h3>Objections: This is a user problem</h3><p>The goal of educating 7 billion people about what JavaScript can do is lofty,
grandiose, ambitious and utterly unattainable. There has to be another solution.


</p><h3>Objections: This is a Facebook problem</h3><p>While it's true that allowing untrusted, unvetted, third party, dynamic content
onto your site is something to avoid, I don't think that fixing this either is
going to happen, or would fix the problem. The attack could easily forward you
to another site to see the clipboard injecting flash, before returning you to
the original site for the 'paste' step.


</p><h3>Objections: This is a Flash problem</h3><p>While it's true that Adobe's clipboard policies are more relaxed than those of
major web browsers, we've seen people caught by instructions that ask people to
select/copy their own attack script. We think that the level of pain caused to
developers by the CSP solution is low enough that we can justify the additional
protection.

My understanding is that Webkit based browsers will be doing the same soon.<br />Why are we ignoring sites that don't have 'X-Content-Security-Policy: no-user-js'. Because we want to disrupt the web as little as possible, and because most sites don't need it. Currently this is overwhelmingly a problem for very large social networks.<br /><div></div></div></p>
